# Social learning using networks in kin-structured populations

## How to run the simulation
Simulations have been written in C++, which means we first need to compile the source code into an executable file and then we can run the executable file to gather results.

### Compiling the simulation code
To compile the simulation code we do
```
make
```
The executable is then named `social_learning_network.exe*`
